Finite Loop

There’s a theorem which states that if P is a prime number and A is natural number, then
AP = A (mod P)
Furthermore, if A is not divisible by P, then
AP-1 = 1 (mod P)
or
AP-1 mod P = 1
In this contest, we will use similar equation as below.
(AB - C) mod P = 1

Given T, following by T lines of three integer A, C, P.
Output smallest non-zero integer B. If no such B exists, output -1.

Constraints
1 = T = 100
1 = P = 1000000
1 = A < P
0 = C < P
It is guaranteed that P is prime number

Sample Input

2
7 1 17
9 0 23

Sample Output

Case #1: 10
Case #2: 11

Sample Case Explanation
For 1st sample case, there is B = 10, which satisfied the equation (710 - 1) mod 17 = 1.
For 2nd sample case, there are B = 11, which satisfied the equation (911 - 0) mod 23 = 1.
